**IMPORTANT REMINDER:** 
For dual-type Pokémon, type effectiveness is multiplicative. 
If a move is super effective against both types, it deals 4x damage. 
If it's not very effective against both types, it deals 0.25x damage. 
If super effective against one type but not very effective against the other, these modifiers cancel out for normal (1x) damage. 
Type immunities always take precedence - if a Pokémon has any type that's immune to an attack, the immunity applies regardless of its other type.

## 🔄 Switching Mechanics 🔄
Switching Pokémon is a critical strategic element in battle. Here are the mechanics you must master:

- **Mandatory Switch (After Fainting)**:
  - If your active Pokémon faints, you **must** switch in another Pokémon. You will be prompted to do, and this will be your only available action.
  - The opponent **cannot attack** during this mandatory switch—your new Pokémon enters safely, and the next turn begins afterward.

- **Voluntary Switch (Strategic Decision)**:
  - You can voluntarily switch your active Pokémon to gain a strategic advantage.
  - Voluntary switches happen **before** the opponent's attack, regardless of either Pokémon's speed.
  - Your incoming Pokémon **will take the hit** from the opponent's next attack—carefully weigh the risks and rewards before switching.
  - This action is risky, as it grants the opponent a **free hit** on your incoming Pokémon.

## STATUS CONDITION MANAGEMENT
- **Sleep Management**: When your Pokémon is asleep, you must still select an attack that will be executed if the Pokémon wakes up during that turn
- **Paralysis Handling**: Account for 25% speed reduction and 25% chance to be fully paralyzed
- **Burn Strategy**: Reduces physical attack by 50% - use on physical attackers
- **Poison Tactics**: Regular poison vs. toxic poison (increasing damage) for war of attrition
- **Freeze Management**: 20% chance to thaw each turn, or immediate thaw from Fire moves
