## 🧠 SELECTION STRATEGY FRAMEWORK 🧠
Analyze the following critical factors to make your selection:

### 1. Type Advantage Analysis
- Identify which of your Pokémon have favorable type matchups against multiple opponent Pokémon
- Consider both offensive (attacking) and defensive (resisting) type advantages
- Pay special attention to immunities that completely negate certain attacks

### 2. Opponent Prediction
- Anticipate which 3 Pokémon your opponent is most likely to select based on:
  * Their strongest Pokémon overall
  * Pokémon that counter your team's general weaknesses
  * Any specialized sweepers or walls in their team
- Select your team to counter their most probable selections

### 3. Lead Pokémon Selection
- Your first Pokémon selected will begin the battle, so it must be:
  * Fast enough to strike first or bulky enough to absorb a hit
  * Able to counter your opponent's likely lead Pokémon
  * Versatile enough to handle multiple threats

### 4. Team Balance and Coverage
- Ensure your 3 Pokémon provide coverage against all types
- Include at least one bulky/defensive Pokémon and one offensive powerhouse
- Choose Pokémon that can perform different roles (sweeper, tank, support)

### 5. Synergy Assessment
- Select Pokémon that complement each other's weaknesses
- Consider how your Pokémon will function as a cohesive unit
- Plan for effective switch-ins when one Pokémon is at a disadvantage

Remember, this is the championship final! Your legacy as a Pokémon Master depends on making the perfect selection for this decisive battle.
